# JSQSystemSoundPlayer 
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jessesquires/JSQSystemSoundPlayer.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/jessesquires/JSQSystemSoundPlayer) [![Version Status](http://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/JSQSystemSoundPlayer.png)][docsLink] [![license MIT](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-orange.png)][mitLink]

A fancy Obj-C wrapper for iOS [System Sound Services](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AudioToolbox/Reference/SystemSoundServicesReference/Reference/reference.html).

This class is a light-weight, drop-in component to play sound effects, or other short sounds in your iOS app. 
To determine your audio needs, see [Best Practices for iOS Audio](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/DOCUMENTATION/AudioVideo/Conceptual/MultimediaPG/UsingAudio/UsingAudio.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009767-CH2-SW10).
Or, read the tl;dr version:

>*When your sole audio need is to play alerts and user-interface sound effects, use Core Audioâ€™s System Sound Services.*
>
>Your sound files must be:
>
>* No longer than 30 seconds in duration
>* In linear PCM or IMA4 (IMA/ADPCM) format
>* Packaged in a `.caf`, `.aif`, or `.wav` file

If this does not fit your needs, then this control is not for you! 
See [AVAudioPlayer](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/DOCUMENTATION/AVFoundation/Reference/AVAudioPlayerClassReference/Reference/Reference.html), instead.

## Features

* Play sound effects and alert sounds with a single line of code
* "Play" vibration (if available on device)
* Block-based completion handlers
* Integration with `NSUserDefaults` to globally toggle sound effects in your app
* Sweet and efficient memory management
* Caches sounds (`SystemSoundID` instances) and purges on memory warning
* Works with Swift! (v2.0.0 and above)

## Requirements

* iOS 6.0+ 
* ARC

## Installation

````
pod 'JSQSystemSoundPlayer'
````
Otherwise, drag the `JSQSystemSoundPlayer/` folder to your project, and add `AudioToolbox.framework`.

## Getting Started

#### Playing sounds

````objective-c
[[JSQSystemSoundPlayer sharedPlayer] playSoundWithFilename:@"mySoundFile"
                                             fileExtension:kJSQSystemSoundTypeAIF
                                                completion:^{
                                                   // completion block code
                                                }];
````

And that's all! 

String constants for file extensions provided for you: 
* `kJSQSystemSoundTypeCAF`
* `kJSQSystemSoundTypeAIF`
* `kJSQSystemSoundTypeAIFF`
* `kJSQSystemSoundTypeWAV`

#### Toggle sounds effects settings on/off

Need a setting in your app's preferences to toggle sound effects on/off? `JSQSystemSoundPlayer` can do that, too! There's no need to ever check the saved settings (`[JSQSystemSoundPlayer sharedPlayer].on`) before you play a sound effect. Just play a sound like in the example above. `JSQSystemSoundPlayer` respects whatever setting has been previously saved.

````objective-c
[[JSQSystemSoundPlayer sharedPlayer] toggleSoundPlayerOn:YES];
````

#### Specifying a bundle

Need to load your audio resources from a specific bundle? `JSQSystemSoundPlayer` uses the main bundle by default, but you can specify another. 

**NOTE:** for each sound that is played `JSQSystemSoundPlayer` will **always** search the **last specified bundle**. If you are playing sound effects from multiple bundles, you will need to specify the bundle before playing each sound.

````objective-c
[JSQSystemSoundPlayer sharedPlayer].bundle = [NSBundle mainBundle];
````

#### Demo

Also see the included demo project: `SoundPlayerDemo.xcodeproj`

#### For a good time

````objective-c
while (1) {
    [[JSQSystemSoundPlayer sharedPlayer] playVibrateSound];
}
````

## Design

Why is this a [Singleton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern)? Singletons are [garbage](https://twitter.com/jesse_squires/status/532800746656239616). I agree! But here's why this is a valid use case:

1. This library manages the use of audio resources. Semantically, you only have 1 sound asset per sound effect. This is akin to `[NSFileManager defaultManager]`. You only have file system from which to read data. 
2. The singleton allows the caching of `SystemSoundID` instances.
