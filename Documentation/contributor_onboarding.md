# Contributor Onboarding

*Contributor onboarding guide for JSQMessagesViewController*

This guide is intended to bring new core contributors up-to-speed on the project, organization, expectations, and best practices.

-------------------------

## Introduction

Welcome! :smile: If you are reading this, then you are (or are about to be) a core contributor! :tada: The goal of this document is to cover everything you need to know about helping to maintain this project. If you are not familiar with the code, the docs, the demo project, and everything else in the repo, then that should be your first step. Otherwise, continue on!

## Getting push access

Being a **contributor** means submitting pull requests, opening issues, etc. Being a **core contributor** means getting push access and other permissions.

We love freely giving push access to great contributors, and always err on trusting contributors with this responsibility. However, before granting you push access we would like to see a few things:

- An interest and dedication to the project
- Helping to triage issues, review pull requests, and diagnose bugs
- Submitting a couple great pull requests

We really prefer to grant push access to contributors who have a decent amount of time to share each week or month. If you cannot be extremely active on the project — that's ok! You can still be an :sparkles: awesome contributor :sparkles: without getting push access! 

The rationale behind all of this is that we do not want to accumulate a *huge* list of **core contributors** that are *not* regularly active.

Remember, *your time* is *your time* — there is absolutely no pressure on you to spend a lot of time on this project, although it is greatly appreciated! :smile:

> **Note:** the rest of this document applies to both **contributors** and **core contributors**, but there are some details that would require having push access.

## Project leads

Jesse Squires ([**@jessesquires**](https://github.com/jessesquires)) serves as the lead for `JSQMessagesViewController`.

Responsibilities include:
- Managing releases and CocoaPods distributions
- Overall guidance on design, architecture, and implementation
- Strategic direction for the library
- Onboarding new core contributors
- Everything under **Core Contributors** :smile:
- Anything not covered by **Core Contributors** :smile:

As core contributors grow and take on more repsonsibility, they can become a lead.

## Core contributors

Core contributors have push access and are responsible for:

- Bug fixes
- New features
- Triaging issues (managing, organizing)
- Answering questions from the community on [issues](https://github.com/jessesquires/JSQMessagesViewController/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22questions+%26+help%22+) and [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jsqmessagesviewcontroller)
- Documentation

Current core contributors:
- Harlan Haskans ([**@harlanhaskins**](https://github.com/harlanhaskins))

## Pushing code

Although you have permissions to push code directly to `develop` or `master` as a **core contributor**, we ask that you *always* submit a pull request for code changes. After a code review and approval, you may merge your diff.
