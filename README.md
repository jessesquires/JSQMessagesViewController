This messages tableview controller is very similar to the iOS Messages app. **Note, this is only a messaging UI, not a messaging app.** This is intended to be used in an existing app where you have (or are developing) a messaging system and need a user interface for it.

## About

This is based on work by @soffes [SSMessagingViewController][1]. I took Soffes' code base and developed this to use in [Hemoglobe](http://www.hemoglobe.com) for private messages between users.

Notable changes from [SSMessagingViewController][1]:

* Brought up-to-date for iOS 6.0 and ARC
* Allows arbitrary message sizes (and message bubble sizes)
* Universal for iPhone and iPad
* Swipe/pull down to hide keyboard
* Dynamically resizes input text view as you type
* Improved hiding/showing keyboard with `NSNotification`
* Automatically enables/disables send button if text view is empty or not
* Refactoring, refinements, and fixes

## Installation

### Using [CocoaPods](http://www.cocoapods.org)

    pod 'MessagesTableViewController'

### From source

* Drag the `MessagesTableViewController/` folder to your project.
* Add the `AudioToolbox.framework` to your project, if you want to use the sound effects
* Subclass `MessagesViewController`
* Override the following methods:
	* `- (BubbleMessageStyle)messageStyleForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath`
		* The style of the bubble for this row
		* Style options are: `BubbleMessageStyleOutgoing` or `BubbleMessageStyleIncoming`
	* `- (NSString *)textForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath`
		* The text to be displayed for this row
	* `- (void)sendPressed:(UIButton *)sender withText:(NSString *)text`
		* Hook into your own backend here
		* Call `[self finishSend]` at the end of this method to animate and reset the text input view
		* Optionally play sound effects with `[MessageSoundEffect playMessageSentSound]` or `[MessageSoundEffect playMessageReceivedSound]`
	* `- (NSInteger)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView numberOfRowsInSection:(NSInteger)section`
		* The API table view data source method that you should be familiar with
* Present view programmatically, **does not work with Storyboards**
* See the included Demo project `MessagesDemo.xcodeproj` for example

## ToDo

* Landscape mode
* Timestamps for messages
* Allow text input view to resize dynamically (i.e., stretch up to top navigation bar like iOS Messages)
* Display "To:" search field for new messages
* Option for user avatar to display next to bubbles
* "Send" images or video
* Storyboards support
